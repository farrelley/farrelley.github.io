The first [Triangle API][1] meetup is in the books and I am looking forward to meeting number two. It took some time to get organized and running but it's going to be worth every day that it was delayed. 

<!-- more --> 

A big thanks to the [TRINUG][2] user group for the support, Steven Suing for giving a great opening talk on "[REST Overview][3]", everyone who came out, and to [Atlantic BT][4] who graciously let us use their space! We are working on scheduling the next meetup for Monday, September 23rd.  We are also looking for speakers for future meetups.  If you are interested and in talking please contact me at farrelley@gmail.com.  Some talks that have been requested are,

* Authentication
* Hypermedia
* Security
* Versioning
* Documentation of API's
* HTTP Methods (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS)
