Yeah Right!? Really, I'm back. I decided to get back in the action to share some of the things that I have discovered with things I have been doing. Specifically in API's, PHP, and Elasticsearch. Since the last time I blogged (years ago) I have been doing a lot with API's, co-founded a company (PintLabs L.L.C.), and moved to North Carolina.

### What am I going to Blog about?
Well first and foremost i'm going to blog about technology and beer stuff. I may from time to time blog about some general ongoings. For the most part it will be technology related.

That's it for now. I will say a bit about the site though. [Farrelley.com][3] is built on top of [PieCrust][1] and hosted with [GitHub pages][2].
