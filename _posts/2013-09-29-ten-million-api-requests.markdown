A big milestone was achieved this week for [PintLabs][1].  Today we announce that we have achieved 10 Million API Requests.  It's amazing how far we have come in such a short time.  It all started as a side project for me when I forked a dataset because I wanted more data.  From there [BreweryMap][2] was created and just a short time later a company called PintLabs was born!  Our first API request was January 7th 2012 at 05:43:19pm. That's just over 600 days ago!

Cheers to the next 600 or so days!  Let there be 10M+ more requests!
